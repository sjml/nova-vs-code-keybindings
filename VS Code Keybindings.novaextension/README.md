**VS Code Keybindings** provides key bindings from **VS Code**, helping you feel right at home in Nova.

## Details

I did my best to mimic VS Code's out-of-the-box keybindings as much as possible, with the following caveats.

* If something required chording (usually ⌘-K followed by another set of keypresses), I omitted it, since Nova doesn't support that method of input. 
* If existing Nova shortcuts did not conflict with VS Code, I left them as-is.
* If existing Nova shortcuts did conflict, they were removed rather than re-assigned elsewhere. 

Not all of the functionality is stuff that I personally use day to day, so my best-guess at matching it to Nova might have been wrong. Please make a pull request if something here seems off to you. 

### Mappings

**Note**: Nova's bindings use combined characters, so this list will contain entries like "⌘-!" where you and I might think of it as "⌘-⇧-1". Such is the way of things.
